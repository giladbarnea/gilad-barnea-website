## How To Use It

You can **just fork or clone** this repository and use it as is.

‚ú® It just works. ‚ú®

### How to Use a Private Repository

If you want to have a private repository, GitHub won't allow you to simply fork it as it doesn't allow changing the visibility of forks.

But you can do the following:

- Create a new GitHub repo, for example `my-full-stack`.
- Clone this repository manually, set the name with the name of the project you want to use, for example `my-full-stack`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git my-full-stack
```

- Enter into the new directory:

```bash
cd my-full-stack
```

- Set the new origin to your new repository, copy it from the GitHub interface, for example:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:octocat/my-full-stack.git
```

- Add this repo as another "remote" to allow you to get updates later:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git
```

- Push the code to your new repository:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### Update From the Original Template

After cloning the repository, and after doing changes, you might want to get the latest changes from this original template.

- Make sure you added the original repository as a remote, you can check it with:

```bash
git remote -v

origin    git@github.com:octocat/my-full-stack.git (fetch)
origin    git@github.com:octocat/my-full-stack.git (push)
upstream    git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.com:fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template.git (push)
```

- Pull the latest changes without merging:

```bash
git pull --no-commit upstream master
```

This will download the latest changes from this template without committing them, that way you can check everything is right before committing.

- If there are conflicts, solve them in your editor.

- Once you are done, commit the changes:

```bash
git merge --continue
```

### Configure

You can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Read the [deployment.md](./deployment.md) docs for more details.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.

## How To Use It - Alternative With Copier

This repository also supports generating a new project using [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io).

It will copy all the files, ask you configuration questions, and update the `.env` files with your answers.

### Install Copier

You can install Copier with:

```bash
pip install copier
```

Or better, if you have [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/), you can run it with:

```bash
pipx install copier
```

**Note**: If you have `pipx`, installing copier is optional, you could run it directly.

### Generate a Project With Copier

Decide a name for your new project's directory, you will use it below. For example, `my-awesome-project`.

Go to the directory that will be the parent of your project, and run the command with your project's name:

```bash
copier copy https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template my-awesome-project --trust
```

If you have `pipx` and you didn't install `copier`, you can run it directly:

```bash
pipx run copier copy https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template my-awesome-project --trust
```

**Note** the `--trust` option is necessary to be able to execute a [post-creation script](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/blob/master/.copier/update_dotenv.py) that updates your `.env` files.

### Input Variables

Copier will ask you for some data, you might want to have at hand before generating the project.

But don't worry, you can just update any of that in the `.env` files afterwards.

The input variables, with their default values (some auto generated) are:

- `project_name`: (default: `"FastAPI Project"`) The name of the project, shown to API users (in .env).
- `stack_name`: (default: `"fastapi-project"`) The name of the stack used for Docker Compose labels and project name (no spaces, no periods) (in .env).
- `secret_key`: (default: `"changethis"`) The secret key for the project, used for security, stored in .env, you can generate one with the method above.
- `first_superuser`: (default: `"admin@example.com"`) The email of the first superuser (in .env).
- `first_superuser_password`: (default: `"changethis"`) The password of the first superuser (in .env).
- `smtp_host`: (default: "") The SMTP server host to send emails, you can set it later in .env.
- `smtp_user`: (default: "") The SMTP server user to send emails, you can set it later in .env.
- `smtp_password`: (default: "") The SMTP server password to send emails, you can set it later in .env.
- `emails_from_email`: (default: `"info@example.com"`) The email account to send emails from, you can set it later in .env.
- `postgres_password`: (default: `"changethis"`) The password for the PostgreSQL database, stored in .env, you can generate one with the method above.
- `sentry_dsn`: (default: "") The DSN for Sentry, if you are using it, you can set it later in .env.

# FastAPI Project - Deployment

You can deploy the project using Docker Compose to a remote server.

This project expects you to have a Traefik proxy handling communication to the outside world and HTTPS certificates.

You can use CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment) systems to deploy automatically, there are already configurations to do it with GitHub Actions.

But you have to configure a couple things first. ü§ì

## Preparation

* Have a remote server ready and available.
* Configure the DNS records of your domain to point to the IP of the server you just created.
* Configure a wildcard subdomain for your domain, so that you can have multiple subdomains for different services, e.g. `*.fastapi-project.example.com`. This will be useful for accessing different components, like `dashboard.fastapi-project.example.com`, `api.fastapi-project.example.com`, `traefik.fastapi-project.example.com`, `adminer.fastapi-project.example.com`, etc. And also for `staging`, like `dashboard.staging.fastapi-project.example.com`, `adminer.staging..fastapi-project.example.com`, etc.
* Install and configure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on the remote server (Docker Engine, not Docker Desktop).

## Public Traefik

We need a Traefik proxy to handle incoming connections and HTTPS certificates.

You need to do these next steps only once.

### Traefik Docker Compose

* Create a remote directory to store your Traefik Docker Compose file:

```bash
mkdir -p /root/code/traefik-public/
```

Copy the Traefik Docker Compose file to your server. You could do it by running the command `rsync` in your local terminal:

```bash
rsync -a docker-compose.traefik.yml root@your-server.example.com:/root/code/traefik-public/
```

### Traefik Public Network

This Traefik will expect a Docker "public network" named `traefik-public` to communicate with your stack(s).

This way, there will be a single public Traefik proxy that handles the communication (HTTP and HTTPS) with the outside world, and then behind that, you could have one or more stacks with different domains, even if they are on the same single server.

To create a Docker "public network" named `traefik-public` run the following command in your remote server:

```bash
docker network create traefik-public
```

### Traefik Environment Variables

The Traefik Docker Compose file expects some environment variables to be set in your terminal before starting it. You can do it by running the following commands in your remote server.

* Create the username for HTTP Basic Auth, e.g.:

```bash
export USERNAME=admin
```

* Create an environment variable with the password for HTTP Basic Auth, e.g.:

```bash
export PASSWORD=changethis
```

* Use openssl to generate the "hashed" version of the password for HTTP Basic Auth and store it in an environment variable:

```bash
export HASHED_PASSWORD=$(openssl passwd -apr1 $PASSWORD)
```

To verify that the hashed password is correct, you can print it:

```bash
echo $HASHED_PASSWORD
```

* Create an environment variable with the domain name for your server, e.g.:

```bash
export DOMAIN=fastapi-project.example.com
```

* Create an environment variable with the email for Let's Encrypt, e.g.:

```bash
export EMAIL=admin@example.com
```

**Note**: you need to set a different email, an email `@example.com` won't work.

### Start the Traefik Docker Compose

Go to the directory where you copied the Traefik Docker Compose file in your remote server:

```bash
cd /root/code/traefik-public/
```

Now with the environment variables set and the `docker-compose.traefik.yml` in place, you can start the Traefik Docker Compose running the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
```

## Deploy the FastAPI Project

Now that you have Traefik in place you can deploy your FastAPI project with Docker Compose.

**Note**: You might want to jump ahead to the section about Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions.

## Environment Variables

You need to set some environment variables first.

Set the `ENVIRONMENT`, by default `local` (for development), but when deploying to a server you would put something like `staging` or `production`:

```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=production
```

Set the `DOMAIN`, by default `localhost` (for development), but when deploying you would use your own domain, for example:

```bash
export DOMAIN=fastapi-project.example.com
```

You can set several variables, like:

* `PROJECT_NAME`: The name of the project, used in the API for the docs and emails.
* `STACK_NAME`: The name of the stack used for Docker Compose labels and project name, this should be different for `staging`, `production`, etc. You could use the same domain replacing dots with dashes, e.g. `fastapi-project-example-com` and `staging-fastapi-project-example-com`.
* `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`: A list of allowed CORS origins separated by commas.
* `SECRET_KEY`: The secret key for the FastAPI project, used to sign tokens.
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER`: The email of the first superuser, this superuser will be the one that can create new users.
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`: The password of the first superuser.
* `SMTP_HOST`: The SMTP server host to send emails, this would come from your email provider (E.g. Mailgun, Sparkpost, Sendgrid, etc).
* `SMTP_USER`: The SMTP server user to send emails.
* `SMTP_PASSWORD`: The SMTP server password to send emails.
* `EMAILS_FROM_EMAIL`: The email account to send emails from.
* `POSTGRES_SERVER`: The hostname of the PostgreSQL server. You can leave the default of `db`, provided by the same Docker Compose. You normally wouldn't need to change this unless you are using a third-party provider.
* `POSTGRES_PORT`: The port of the PostgreSQL server. You can leave the default. You normally wouldn't need to change this unless you are using a third-party provider.
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The Postgres password.
* `POSTGRES_USER`: The Postgres user, you can leave the default.
* `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name to use for this application. You can leave the default of `app`.
* `SENTRY_DSN`: The DSN for Sentry, if you are using it.

## GitHub Actions Environment Variables

There are some environment variables only used by GitHub Actions that you can configure:

* `LATEST_CHANGES`: Used by the GitHub Action [latest-changes](https://github.com/tiangolo/latest-changes) to automatically add release notes based on the PRs merged. It's a personal access token, read the docs for details.
* `SMOKESHOW_AUTH_KEY`: Used to handle and publish the code coverage using [Smokeshow](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/smokeshow), follow their instructions to create a (free) Smokeshow key.

### Generate secret keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.

### Deploy with Docker Compose

With the environment variables in place, you can deploy with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

For production you wouldn't want to have the overrides in `docker-compose.override.yml`, that's why we explicitly specify `docker-compose.yml` as the file to use.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

You can use GitHub Actions to deploy your project automatically. üòé

You can have multiple environment deployments.

There are already two environments configured, `staging` and `production`. üöÄ

### Install GitHub Actions Runner

* On your remote server, create a user for your GitHub Actions:

```bash
sudo adduser github
```

* Add Docker permissions to the `github` user:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker github
```

* Temporarily switch to the `github` user:

```bash
sudo su - github
```

* Go to the `github` user's home directory:

```bash
cd
```

* [Install a GitHub Action self-hosted runner following the official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-a-repository).

* When asked about labels, add a label for the environment, e.g. `production`. You can also add labels later.

After installing, the guide would tell you to run a command to start the runner. Nevertheless, it would stop once you terminate that process or if your local connection to your server is lost.

To make sure it runs on startup and continues running, you can install it as a service. To do that, exit the `github` user and go back to the `root` user:

```bash
exit
```

After you do it, you will be on the previous user again. And you will be on the previous directory, belonging to that user.

Before being able to go the `github` user directory, you need to become the `root` user (you might already be):

```bash
sudo su
```

* As the `root` user, go to the `actions-runner` directory inside of the `github` user's home directory:

```bash
cd /home/github/actions-runner
```

* Install the self-hosted runner as a service with the user `github`:

```bash
./svc.sh install github
```

* Start the service:

```bash
./svc.sh start
```

* Check the status of the service:

```bash
./svc.sh status
```

You can read more about it in the official guide: [Configuring the self-hosted runner application as a service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service).

### Set Secrets

On your repository, configure secrets for the environment variables you need, the same ones described above, including `SECRET_KEY`, etc. Follow the [official GitHub guide for setting repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

The current Github Actions workflows expect these secrets:

* `DOMAIN_PRODUCTION`
* `DOMAIN_STAGING`
* `STACK_NAME_PRODUCTION`
* `STACK_NAME_STAGING`
* `EMAILS_FROM_EMAIL`
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER`
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
* `SECRET_KEY`
* `LATEST_CHANGES`
* `SMOKESHOW_AUTH_KEY`

## GitHub Action Deployment Workflows

There are GitHub Action workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory already configured for deploying to the environments (GitHub Actions runners with the labels):

* `staging`: after pushing (or merging) to the branch `master`.
* `production`: after publishing a release.

If you need to add extra environments you could use those as a starting point.

# FastAPI Project - Development

## Docker Compose

* Start the local stack with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose watch
```

* Now you can open your browser and interact with these URLs:

Frontend, built with Docker, with routes handled based on the path: http://localhost:5173

Backend, JSON based web API based on OpenAPI: http://localhost:8000

Automatic interactive documentation with Swagger UI (from the OpenAPI backend): http://localhost:8000/docs

Adminer, database web administration: http://localhost:8080

Traefik UI, to see how the routes are being handled by the proxy: http://localhost:8090

**Note**: The first time you start your stack, it might take a minute for it to be ready. While the backend waits for the database to be ready and configures everything. You can check the logs to monitor it.

To check the logs, run (in another terminal):

```bash
docker compose logs
```

To check the logs of a specific service, add the name of the service, e.g.:

```bash
docker compose logs backend
```

## Local Development

The Docker Compose files are configured so that each of the services is available in a different port in `localhost`.

For the backend and frontend, they use the same port that would be used by their local development server, so, the backend is at `http://localhost:8000` and the frontend at `http://localhost:5173`.

This way, you could turn off a Docker Compose service and start its local development service, and everything would keep working, because it all uses the same ports.

For example, you can stop that `frontend` service in the Docker Compose, in another terminal, run:

```bash
docker compose stop frontend
```

And then start the local frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Or you could stop the `backend` Docker Compose service:

```bash
docker compose stop backend
```

And then you can run the local development server for the backend:

```bash
cd backend
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

## Docker Compose in `localhost.tiangolo.com`

When you start the Docker Compose stack, it uses `localhost` by default, with different ports for each service (backend, frontend, adminer, etc).

When you deploy it to production (or staging), it will deploy each service in a different subdomain, like `api.example.com` for the backend and `dashboard.example.com` for the frontend.

In the guide about [deployment](deployment.md) you can read about Traefik, the configured proxy. That's the component in charge of transmitting traffic to each service based on the subdomain.

If you want to test that it's all working locally, you can edit the local `.env` file, and change:

```dotenv
DOMAIN=localhost.tiangolo.com
```

That will be used by the Docker Compose files to configure the base domain for the services.

Traefik will use this to transmit traffic at `api.localhost.tiangolo.com` to the backend, and traffic at `dashboard.localhost.tiangolo.com` to the frontend.

The domain `localhost.tiangolo.com` is a special domain that is configured (with all its subdomains) to point to `127.0.0.1`. This way you can use that for your local development.

After you update it, run again:

```bash
docker compose watch
```

When deploying, for example in production, the main Traefik is configured outside of the Docker Compose files. For local development, there's an included Traefik in `docker-compose.override.yml`, just to let you test that the domains work as expected, for example with `api.localhost.tiangolo.com` and `dashboard.localhost.tiangolo.com`.

## Docker Compose files and env vars

There is a main `docker-compose.yml` file with all the configurations that apply to the whole stack, it is used automatically by `docker compose`.

And there's also a `docker-compose.override.yml` with overrides for development, for example to mount the source code as a volume. It is used automatically by `docker compose` to apply overrides on top of `docker-compose.yml`.

These Docker Compose files use the `.env` file containing configurations to be injected as environment variables in the containers.

They also use some additional configurations taken from environment variables set in the scripts before calling the `docker compose` command.

After changing variables, make sure you restart the stack:

```bash
docker compose watch
```

## The .env file

The `.env` file is the one that contains all your configurations, generated keys and passwords, etc.

Depending on your workflow, you could want to exclude it from Git, for example if your project is public. In that case, you would have to make sure to set up a way for your CI tools to obtain it while building or deploying your project.

One way to do it could be to add each environment variable to your CI/CD system, and updating the `docker-compose.yml` file to read that specific env var instead of reading the `.env` file.

## Pre-commits and code linting

we are using a tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for code linting and formatting.

When you install it, it runs right before making a commit in git. This way it ensures that the code is consistent and formatted even before it is committed.

You can find a file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with configurations at the root of the project.

#### Install pre-commit to run automatically

`pre-commit` is already part of the dependencies of the project, but you could also install it globally if you prefer to, following [the official pre-commit docs](https://pre-commit.com/).

After having the `pre-commit` tool installed and available, you need to "install" it in the local repository, so that it runs automatically before each commit.

Using `uv`, you could do it with:

```bash
‚ùØ uv run pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now whenever you try to commit, e.g. with:

```bash
git commit
```

...pre-commit will run and check and format the code you are about to commit, and will ask you to add that code (stage it) with git again before committing.

Then you can `git add` the modified/fixed files again and now you can commit.

#### Running pre-commit hooks manually

you can also run `pre-commit` manually on all the files, you can do it using `uv` with:

```bash
‚ùØ uv run pre-commit run --all-files
check for added large files..............................................Passed
check toml...............................................................Passed
check yaml...............................................................Passed
ruff.....................................................................Passed
ruff-format..............................................................Passed
eslint...................................................................Passed
prettier.................................................................Passed
```

# USER MESSAGE

i have bought the domain gilad-barnea.com. i have a free Supabase account, and i have created a project which imports this github repo. i have modified the three keys in .env where instructed: POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres, FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD, and SECRET_KEY. i want to deploy the code to my domain, for free if possible (i am ok with slow compute, no auth/security etc), and in a straightforward way. does Supabase give all I need?
</USER>

<ASSISTANT>
Supabase alone won't give you everything you need for this full-stack FastAPI template. Here's what Supabase provides vs. what you need:

**What Supabase gives you:**
- PostgreSQL database (which you have)
- Authentication (though the template uses its own JWT auth)
- Some hosting for simple functions

**What you still need:**
- A place to host the FastAPI backend
- A place to host the React frontend
- Domain configuration and SSL certificates

**Recommended free deployment approach:**

1. **Backend (FastAPI)**: Deploy to **Railway** or **Render** (free tiers)
   - Both offer free PostgreSQL + app hosting
   - Railway: 500 hours/month free
   - Render: Free tier with some limitations

2. **Frontend (React)**: Deploy to **Vercel** or **Netlify** (free tiers)
   - Both offer excellent free hosting for React apps
   - Automatic deployments from GitHub

3. **Database**: You can use either:
   - Supabase PostgreSQL (free tier: 500MB, 2 concurrent connections)
   - Railway/Render's included PostgreSQL

**Simplest path forward:**

1. **Use Railway for everything** (backend + database):
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

2. **Deploy frontend to Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
   - Set build command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Set output directory: `frontend/dist`

3. **Configure your domain**:
   - Point `api.gilad-barnea.com` to Railway
   - Point `gilad-barnea.com` to Vercel

Would you like me to walk you through the Railway deployment process, or would you prefer to try a different approach?
</ASSISTANT>

<USER>
Railway or Render do not support uploadin a frontend React like Vercel of Netlify? And vice versa? i prefer sticking with the least amount of different services. 

</USER>

<ASSISTANT>
You're absolutely right to want fewer services! Here are your options for keeping it simple:

**Option 1: Railway for everything** (my recommendation)
- Railway CAN host both backend and frontend
- Deploy the full Docker Compose stack to Railway
- Single service, single bill, single configuration
- Railway supports Docker Compose deployments

**Option 2: Render for everything**
- Render also supports both backend and frontend
- Can deploy the Docker setup or separate services
- Also supports Docker Compose

**Option 3: Vercel for everything** (limited)
- Vercel has backend support via serverless functions
- But FastAPI + PostgreSQL is tricky on Vercel
- Not ideal for this full-stack template

**I'd recommend Railway** because:
1. It handles Docker Compose deployments well
2. Built-in PostgreSQL 
3. Can serve both your FastAPI backend and React frontend
4. Simple domain configuration
5. Good free tier

**Railway deployment steps:**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# In your project directory
railway login
railway init
railway up

# Configure your domain
railway domain add gilad-barnea.com
```

Railway will:
- Build your Docker containers
- Provide PostgreSQL database
- Handle SSL certificates
- Serve both frontend and backend

Would you like me to guide you through the Railway setup, or do you want to try Render instead? Both can handle your entire stack in one place.
</ASSISTANT>

<USER>
It seems Railway shut down their free tier. Render has a free tier though
</USER>

<ASSISTANT>
You're absolutely right! Railway discontinued their free tier. Render is indeed a better choice now with their free tier still available.

**Render free tier includes:**
- 750 hours/month of compute (enough for a personal project)
- PostgreSQL database (90 days, then $7/month)
- Static site hosting (unlimited)
- SSL certificates
- Custom domains

**Two approaches with Render:**

**Option 1: All on Render (simplest)**
- Deploy backend as a "Web Service" 
- Deploy frontend as a "Static Site"
- Use Render's PostgreSQL or keep Supabase

**Option 2: Render + Vercel (potentially better performance)**
- Backend on Render
- Frontend on Vercel (better for React apps)
- Database: Supabase (since you already have it)

**I'd recommend Option 2** because:
- Vercel is optimized for React/frontend
- Supabase gives you a permanent free database
- Render handles the FastAPI backend well

**Setup steps:**
1. **Backend to Render**: Connect GitHub repo, deploy from `./backend`
2. **Frontend to Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo, deploy from `./frontend` 
3. **Database**: Keep using Supabase
4. **Domain**: Point `api.gilad-barnea.com` to Render, `gilad-barnea.com` to Vercel

Would you like me to walk through the Render backend deployment first?
</ASSISTANT>

<USER>
Given the following Render monorepo support documentation:

<Render_Monorepo_Support_Documentation>
# Monorepo Support

.build-filters-rich-text ~ ol + p .gatsby-resp-image-wrapper {
  margin-bottom: 52px;
}

.build-filters-rich-text ~ table code {
  white-space: nowrap;
}

If you're using the same repo for multiple Render services, you will want to configure the code changes that trigger deploys for each service. Regardless of your project's structure, changes to a specific file in your code don't need to trigger builds and deploys for every service associated with the repo. Monorepo Support helps you deploy just the services you need to eliminate unnecessary deploys, control build costs, and ship faster.

Monorepo Support offers two configuration mechanisms. For any service running on Render, you can define a [root directory](#root-directory) and/or specify [build filters](#build-filters) to configure when the service is built and deployed in response to code changes.

Defining the root directory for a service ensures changes to files inside the root directory trigger a build and deploy. Changes to files outside the root directory will not trigger a build for the service.

Specifying build filters for a service allows you to use [glob patterns](/docs/monorepo-support#glob-syntax) to include and exclude individual file paths for which changes trigger a build.

Using root directory and build filters simplifies your build and deploy process. Changes are rolled out faster and any resulting notifications are relevant to the recent changes pushed to the Git repository.

## Sample monorepo

## Root directory

Render will build and deploy your service when you push changes to file paths inside the defined root directory. Changes to file paths outside the defined root directory are ignored, and Render will not build and deploy your service.

The default value of a service‚Äôs root directory is the top-level directory of the Git repository. You can define the root directory for a service as any sub-directory of your Git repository. In the example monorepo above, `backend` and `community/docker` are possible definitions of the backend and community service‚Äôs respective root directory.

## Defining the root directory

The root directory for a service can be defined from either the Render Dashboard or a Blueprint Spec.

### Dashboard

1. In the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com), open the **Settings** page for the service you want to configure.

2. Scroll down to the **Build & Deploy** section and find the **Root Directory** setting:

3. Click **Edit**.

4. Enter the root directory you want to use.

5. Click **Save Changes**.

6. In the dialog that appears, verify your service's build and start commands (which will now run relative to the new root directory).

7. Click **Update Fields**.

### Example Blueprint spec

For a [monorepo like this sample](#sample-monorepo), defining the root directory in a [Blueprint](/docs/blueprint-spec) Spec looks like the following:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: app-backend
    runtime: go
    rootDir: backend
    buildCommand: go build -o app .
    startCommand: ./app
  - type: web
    name: app-community
    runtime: docker
    rootDir: community/docker
    dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
    dockerContext: .
```

<info-block>

In the above example, the `buildCommand`, `startCommand`, `dockerfilePath`, and `dockerContext` values are all relative to the root directory defined for each service using the `rootDir` key.

</info-block>

## Settings relative to root directory

Render runs commands and interacts with files relative to each service's root directory. The service's Build Command, Start Command, Publish Directory, Dockerfile Path, and Docker Build Context Directory are all affected by defining a root directory. Each of these commands and file paths must take the service's defined root directory into account.

In a [monorepo like this sample](#sample-monorepo), without a defined root directory, the service's Build Command might look something like the following:

```shell
cd backend && go build -o app .
```

Setting the service's root directory to the `backend` directory simplifies the Build Command to the following:

```shell
go build -o app .
```

## Build filters

Build filters allow you to build and deploy a service only when certain files change and to ignore all other changes.

In a [monorepo like this sample](#sample-monorepo), specifying build filters ensures that the frontend service is only deployed when changes to static files occur, and that the backend service is likewise only deployed when a change occurs in a Go file.

You can configure build filters for each Render service by using **included** paths, **ignored** paths, or _both_.

### Included paths

Changing a file that matches a [glob](/docs/monorepo-support#glob-syntax) specified as part of the **Included Paths** list will start a new build. If **Included Paths** is empty, we default to matching all files.

### Ignored paths

Changing a file that matches a [glob](/docs/monorepo-support#glob-syntax) specified as part of the **Ignored Paths** list will not start a new build. If **Ignored Paths** is empty, we do not ignore any files.

Files matching both **Included Paths** and **Ignored Paths** will be ignored and will not trigger a new build. For example, in a [monorepo like this sample](#sample-monorepo), adding `backend/**` as both an Included Path and Ignored Path would cause the `backend` directory to be ignored and changes to its contents will not trigger a new build.

<info-block>

Paths for build filters are always relative to the top-level directory of your repository, even if you‚Äôve defined the [root directory](#root-directory) for the service. This makes it possible for you to define paths for a service‚Äôs build filters that are outside the root directory for that service.

</info-block>

## Specifying build filters

You can specify build filters on the Render Dashboard or as part of a Blueprint Spec.

### Dashboard

1. In the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/), open the **Settings** page for the service you want to configure.

2. Scroll down to the **Build & Deploy** section and find the **Build Filters** setting:

3. Click **Edit**.

4. Click **Add Included Path** and/or **Add Ignored Path** as needed.

5. Enter the glob patterns for all paths you want to include and ignore.

6. Click **Save Changes**.

### Example Blueprint spec

In a [monorepo like this sample](#sample-monorepo), the [Blueprint Spec](/docs/blueprint-spec), would be something like:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: app-frontend
    branch: main
    runtime: static
    buildCommand: cd frontend; yarn; yarn build
    staticPublishPath: ./frontend/build/
    # Build and deploy `app-frontend` if any `js` file changes,
    # but ignore any test files.
    buildFilter:
      paths:
        - frontend/**/*.js
      ignoredPaths:
        - frontend/**/*.test.js
```

### Glob syntax

<info-block>
  Globs are patterns that are used to succinctly specify a set of matching filenames by using special wildcard characters.
</info-block>

## Using root directory and build filters together

<info-block>

If you have defined a root directory, it is not necessary to include it as a build filter.

</info-block>

It is possible to simultaneously define the root directory and specify build filters for a service. In a [monorepo like this sample](#sample-monorepo), the [Blueprint Spec](/docs/blueprint-spec) might look like:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: app-backend
    branch: main
    runtime: go
    # Build and deploy `app-backend` if any files change
    # within the `backend` or `community/docker` folders.
    rootDir: backend
    buildCommand: go build -o app .
    startCommand: ./app
    buildFilter:
      paths:
        - community/docker/**
```

## Pull request previews

Root directory and build filters enable you to control the creation of [pull request previews](/docs/service-previews#pull-request-previews-git-backed) for your services.

In this [example monorepo](#sample-monorepo), if you define the root directory as `backend` for the backend service; and if you then create a Pull Request that only changes files in the backend directory, Render will create a Pull Request Preview only for the backend service and will not create a Pull Request Preview for the frontend service.

```yaml
services:
  - name: app-backend
    rootDir: backend
```

The same is true for build filters. If you specify one or more build filter paths for the frontend service; and if you then create a Pull Request that only changes files that match those paths, Render will create a Pull Request Preview only for the frontend service and will not create a Pull Request Preview for the backend service.

```yaml
services:
  - name: app-frontend
    buildFilter:
      paths:
        - frontend/**/*.js
      ignoredPaths:
        - frontend/**/*.test.js
```

## FAQ

#### Can I ignore the `render.yaml` file?

No, changes to `render.yaml` are always processed regardless of the patterns specified in `buildFilter`. [Blueprint syncs](/docs/infrastructure-as-code) are also unaffected by the `buildFilter` setting.

#### Do build filters apply to manual deploys?

A manual deploy will always trigger a build and deploy using the latest Git commit, regardless of any build filters.

#### What if I have `autoDeploy` turned off for a service?

Turning `autoDeploy` off prevents automatic deploys for your Render Service; however, root directory and build filters for that service will decide if Render should create a Pull Request Preview.

#### What if my service has no build filters?

Any new commit will trigger a build and deploy for services by default.

#### What if my service has no root directory?

The default root directory for a service is the top-level directory of the repository.

#### What happens when I update a setting that triggers a new build?

Updating your service's Build Command or any other setting that triggers a new build will always deploy the latest Git commit from your repo.

#### Do build filters and root directory work with preview environments?

Yes. If you define the root directory or specify build filters for each service in your Blueprint Spec, Render will only create a [Preview Environment](/docs/preview-environments) if the files changed in a pull request match the root directory or build filter paths for at least one service.

#### If I change the root directory will it affect the build filters for my service?

Paths for build filters are always relative to the top-level directory of your repository, even if you‚Äôve defined the [root directory](#root-directory) for the service. This makes it possible for you to define paths for a service‚Äôs build filters that are outside the root directory for that service.

#### If I change the root directory, will it affect auto-deploys for my service?

If you define the root directory for a service, Render will only build and deploy your service when you push changes within that root directory.

For example, if you define the root directory as `backend`, Render will build and deploy your service if you push changes to any files inside the `backend` directory and ignore any changes you push to other directories.

#### If I define the root directory, do I need to add that same path as a build filter?

You don‚Äôt have to add that same path as a build filter.

Defining the root directory for a service ensures changes to files inside the root directory trigger a build and deploy. Changes to files outside the root directory will not trigger a build for the service.

Yes, you can deploy the entire monorepo as one service on Render! This is actually simpler and matches how the project is designed with Docker Compose.

Looking at your project structure, it's set up to run as a unified stack with the main `docker-compose.yml` file at the root. Here's how to deploy it as a single service:

**Deploy as Docker service on Render:**

1. **Create a Web Service** on Render
2. **Connect your GitHub repo**
3. **Configure the service:**
   - **Runtime**: Docker
   - **Root Directory**: Leave empty (use entire repo)
   - **Dockerfile Path**: `docker-compose.yml` (or create a single Dockerfile)
   - **Build Command**: `docker-compose build`
   - **Start Command**: `docker-compose up`

**However, there's a challenge**: Render's Docker support expects a single Dockerfile, not docker-compose.

**Better approach - Create a unified Dockerfile:**

Create a new `Dockerfile` at your project root:

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build
FROM node:18 as frontend-build
WORKDIR /app/frontend
COPY frontend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY frontend/ ./
RUN npm run build

FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app

# Install backend dependencies
COPY backend/pyproject.toml backend/uv.lock ./backend/
RUN pip install uv && cd backend && uv sync

# Copy backend code
COPY backend/ ./backend/

# Copy built frontend
COPY --from=frontend-build /app/frontend/dist ./frontend/dist

# Serve both frontend and backend
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["python", "backend/app/main.py"]
```

**Alternative - Use Render's monorepo support:**

Deploy two services but configure them to work together:
- **Backend service**: `rootDir: backend`
- **Frontend service**: `rootDir: frontend` 
- Configure build filters so they only deploy when their respective folders change

**My recommendation**: Try the unified Dockerfile approach first. It's simpler and keeps everything in one service, which is what you want.

Would you like me to help you create the unified Dockerfile, or would you prefer to try the two-service approach with monorepo configuration?
</ASSISTANT>

<USER>
great, thanks. I used a unified Dockerfile like you suggested. I have attached the final parts in Render deploy web service form to this conversation. should I fill in something specific? remember the deployment.md information
</USER>

<ASSISTANT>
Perfect! Here's what you should fill in based on the deployment.md documentation and your setup:

## Health Check Path
```
/api/v1/utils/health-check/
```
(This matches the healthcheck in docker-compose.yml)

## Docker Build Context Directory
```
.
```
(Keep as root since your Dockerfile is at the project root)

## Dockerfile Path
```
./Dockerfile
```
(Or just `Dockerfile` if that's what you named it)

## Pre-Deploy Command
```
python backend/scripts/prestart.sh
```
(This runs database migrations - important!)

## Environment Variables
Click "Add from .env" to import your existing variables, then add these production-specific ones:

**Required variables:**
- `ENVIRONMENT` = `production`
- `DOMAIN` = `gilad-barnea.com`
- `FRONTEND_HOST` = `https://gilad-barnea.com`
- `POSTGRES_SERVER` = (your Supabase database host)
- `POSTGRES_USER` = (your Supabase database user)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` = (your Supabase database password)
- `POSTGRES_DB` = (your Supabase database name)
- `POSTGRES_PORT` = `5432`

**Keep your existing:**
- `SECRET_KEY` = (the one you generated)
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` = (the one you set)
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER` = `admin@example.com`

## Build Filters
Leave empty for now (deploy on any change)

## Auto-Deploy
Keep "On Commit" (deploys automatically when you push to GitHub)

The most important part is getting the Supabase database connection details right. You'll find these in your Supabase project settings under "Database" ‚Üí "Connection info".
